### Problem Statement
1. Enabling a patient-centered information exchange system.
2. Personal medical assistant.

### Idea In Brief
Creating a network between patients, doctors and chemists and hence, making things easier for all of them by creating a unique Medical ID. For instance, keeping medical records efficiently, creating paperless solution across nation and maintaining transparency for the flow of sensitive information like prescriptions offered by doctor to a patient, and the identification of the same by chemists using a unique patient ID. 

### Future Plans 
- Connecting, Chemists, Doctors and Patients altogether.
- Making things easier for doctors, patients & chemists.
- Least discrepancy of the harmful drugs/medicines.
- Regular updates to patients regarding their health.
- Creating a network for better future.
- Suggestions for better maintaining health.

## The Problem Dawaihaq Solves 
- India doesn't have a centralised database system for medical records of individuals residing in the country. Currently, there is very less transparency or flow of information between chemists & doctors which results in discrepancies and misuse of drugs, and eventually leads to various malpractices. Using the centralised database, this problem can be tackled by making the prescription digital and link to the patient's unique ID and later connecting all of this with the Aadhar Card for bio-metric Authentication. 

- People have to rely on stacks of files for keeping record of their medical history.As a sector that strives to establish a healthy world, digitalization or the paperless operations system in healthcare industry is a necessity than a need.

- With this, we'll also keep the patients profile up to date for ease and update the Appointments and Prescription data according to the visits.
